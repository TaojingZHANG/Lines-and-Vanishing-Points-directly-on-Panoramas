## Introduction

In panoramas, a straight line in the world is projected as an arc segment on a great circle onto the sphere and thus it appears as a curved line segment in the image. For this reason, we represent each line by the normal vector of the 3D projective plane that includes the line itself and the camera center. 
We adopt the Manhattan World assumption whereby there exist three dominant orthogonal directions. Another particularity of this type of projection is that parallel lines in the world intersect in two antipodal VP whereas in conventional images they do in one single VP.
We detect lines and VP by a RANSAC-based algorithm that works directly with panoramas showing entire and unique line segments.

## Use Instructions
